# Object Expiration

If you use Tigris to store objects that have a limited lifetime, you can now set
up lifecycle configuration rules to automatically delete them after a specified
period.

## Configuring object expiration

Tigris allows you to set up a Time-To-Live (TTL) configuration for objects in a
bucket. This configuration can be used to automatically delete objects after a
specified period.

The TTL can be set in two ways:

- **Days**: The objects will be deleted after the specified number of days.
- **Date**: The objects will be deleted on the specified date.

### Specifying expiration rules via the Tigris Dashboard

You can specify expiration rules for your bucket using the
[Tigris Dashboard](https://console.tigris.dev/).

Here's a short video that demonstrates how to specify expiration rules for a
bucket:

### Specifying expiration rules via the AWS CLI

You can configure expiration rules for objects in the bucket using AWS the CLI.
Below are some examples of how you can configure the expiration rules.

#### Expire objects after 30 days

Here's an example of a lifecycle configuration that expires objects after 30
days.

Create a JSON file named `lifecycle.json` with the following content:

```json
{
  "Rules": [
    {
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "Expiration": {
        "Days": 30
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Then, run the following command to apply the lifecycle configuration to the
bucket:

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration --bucket my-bucket --lifecycle-configuration file://lifecycle.json
```

#### Expire objects at the end of the year 2024

Here's an example of a lifecycle configuration that expires objects at the end
of the year 2024.

Create a JSON file named `lifecycle.json` with the following content:

```json
{
  "Rules": [
    {
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "Expiration": {
        "Date": "2024-12-31T00:00:00Z"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Then, run the following command to apply the lifecycle configuration to the
bucket:

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration --bucket my-bucket --lifecycle-configuration file://lifecycle.json
```

## Things to note

- Tigris always rounds the TTL deletion time to UTC midnight for the scheduled
  date.
- Only one expiration rule can be applied to a bucket at a time.
- When using the AWS CLI to apply a lifecycle configuration, the JSON can only
  contain the fields shown in the examples above.
