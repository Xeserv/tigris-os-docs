The Tigris Community is in the following places:

- The [Tigris Discord](#tigris-discord)
- The [Tigris Data GitHub org](#tigris-github)

To participate in any Tigris Community destination, you must agree to the
[Tigris Community Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.mdx).

## <DiscordIcon /> Tigris Discord {#tigris-discord}

The <a href={tigrisConfig.discordUrl}>Tigris Discord</a> is somewhere you can go
to ask for help with Tigris and meet the code Tigris team and other community
members.

In addition to following the
[Tigris Community Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.mdx), we have two
guidelines that we believe make it easier for community members to have
discussions and make the community more excellent.

1. Use
   [Discord Threads](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403205878423-Threads-FAQ)
   and do not use inline replies. Discord Threads make it much easier to follow
   a conversation.
2. Liberally apply
   [Discord Reactions](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041139231-Adding-Emojis-and-Reactions).
   If somebody has taken the time to write a message then a reaction is a great
   way to let them know that their contribution hasn't gone unnoticed.

Join the <a href={tigrisConfig.discordUrl}>Tigris Discord</a>.

Here's an overview of our Discord channels and how you can use them:

### 📋 Welcome

The
[welcome channel](https://discord.com/channels/1033842669983633488/1033855320105160724)
only ever has one message guiding how to use the Tigris Discord. The welcome
channel has a similar purpose to this page.

### 📣 Announcements

Tigris Discord moderators use the
[#announcements channel](https://discord.com/channels/1033842669983633488/1033843112252026980)
for important updates. These are mostly Tigris platform product updates but may
also be Discord or Tigris Data company updates. `@channel` will be used for
important updates that all community members should know about. For example:

- A breaking change in the Tigris platform or an SDK
- A new product or feature release

### 🌱 Community/introductions

When you join the Tigris Discord, please introduce yourself to the rest of the
community in the
[#introductions channel](https://discord.com/channels/1033842669983633488/1033843156833288255).
When you do this, we recommend you share the following, but don't let this
restrict you:

- 💻 What technologies do you use?
- 🛠 What do you plan to build? Did you find Tigris and have plans for something
  already?
- 🌍 Where are you from? The Tigris team has people living worldwide, and we
  hope our community is too. Share your flag!

### 🌱 Community/general

The
[#general channel](https://discord.com/channels/1033842669983633488/1033842670470176790)
is the default channel and a place to drop a message if it doesn't make sense in
any other channel or forum. Questions about how to achieve something using
Tigris should go in the [🌱 Community/help channel](#community-help).

### 🌱 Community/help

The
[#help channel](https://discord.com/channels/1033842669983633488/1033855793029718016)
is a [Discord forum] and the best place to ask a question about how to achieve
something with Tigris. The Tigris team will be on-hand to help.

### 🌱 Community/chit-chat

Use the
[#chit-chat channel](https://discord.com/channels/1033842669983633488/1065266309660688434)
to hang out. Feel free to post things that are of general interest to the
community. It's also OK to post something a little off-topic (for example, TV,
movies, and games) as long as they adhere to the
[Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.mdx).

### 🌱 Community/showcase

Use the
[#showcase channel](https://discord.com/channels/1033842669983633488/1105481082347978842)
to share anything that you have done with Tigris. Have a blog post, a new
project you have built or are you using Tigris in production? Share it here, we
love hearing about it.

### 🙌 Contribute/platform

Our team posts frequent updates and shared pull requests in the
[#platform channel](https://discord.com/channels/1033842669983633488/1033843208192524348).
So if you want to get into the depths of Tigris, this channel is for you.
