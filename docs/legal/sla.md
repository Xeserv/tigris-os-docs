# Service Level Agreement

The following Service Level Agreement between Tigris Data, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Tigris Data," "we," or "us"), and Customer will apply to the
Tigris Object Storage Service (the "Service") for Customers with an Enterprise
plan during the applicable Subscription Term.

## Platform Uptime

### 1. Uptime Commitment

Tigris Data will provide Actual Availability for the Service for at least 99.9%
of the total time in each calendar month during the Subscription Term, as
measured by Tigris Data (the "Uptime Commitment").

### 2. Service Credits

If the Uptime Commitment is not met during any particular calendar month during
the Subscription Term, then Customer will be eligible for a service credit
(“Service Credit”), provided that Customer reports to Tigris Data such failure
to meet the Uptime Commitment and requests such Service Credit in accordance
with this Exhibit. The amount of any Service Credit due hereunder shall be
calculated as follows: X \* Y, where X = the total fees due from Customer to
Tigris Data for the affected Services for the relevant calendar month
(regardless of when billed or payable), and Y = the Credit Percentage
corresponding with the Actual Availability provided (as a percentage of total
time) for the relevant calendar month, as set forth in the table below.

| **Actual Availability**                            | **Credit Percentage** |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Less than 99.9% but greater than or equal to 99.0% | 10%                   |
| Less than 99.0% but greater than or equal to 98.0% | 15%                   |
| Less than 98.0% but greater than or equal to 96.0% | 20%                   |
| Less than 96.0%                                    | 30%                   |

### 3. Credit Requests and Payment

To request a Service Credit, Customer must send an email to Tigris Data
help@tigrisdata.com within thirty (30) days of the end of the month in which the
Uptime Commitment was not met. Customer must include either its organization
name or registered support email address, and the previously reported dates and
times that there was no Service Availability. If Tigris Data confirms that
Customer is eligible for a Service Credit, Tigris Data will issue a credit to
Customer’s account within thirty (30) days. Service Credits are not refunds,
cannot be exchanged into a cash amount, and may only be used against future
billing charges. Except as set forth in Section 4 below, the Service Credits
shall be Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy, and Tigris Data’s sole and
exclusive liability, for any failure by Tigris Data to meet the Uptime
Commitment.
