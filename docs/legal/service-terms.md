This Agreement (the "**Agreement**") contains the terms and conditions that
govern access to and use of the Tigris Object Storage Service (as defined below)
and creates a binding contract between User (as defined below) and Tigris Data
Inc. ("**Tigris Data**," "**we**," or "**us**"). Please see Section 23 for
definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement.

## Terms

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS CAREFULLY:

**BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT,” OR BY ACCESSING OR USING THE TIGRIS OBJECT STORAGE
SERVICE**, YOU (“User” or “you”) AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND,
AS A CONDITION TO YOUR USE OF THE TIGRIS OBJECT STORAGE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY, THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND TIGRIS DATA’S PRIVACY POLICY, WHICH IS
INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. IF AN INDIVIDUAL IS ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT
ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, SUCH INDIVIDUAL (AN “ENTERPRISE
USER”) REPRESENTS THAT THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY TO THE TERMS
OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND THE TERMS “User” AND “you” AS USED IN THIS AGREEMENT WILL
REFER TO SUCH ENTITY. IF THE INDIVIDUAL ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT IS NOT
ELIGIBLE, DOES NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR DOES NOT HAVE SUCH
AUTHORITY, SUCH INDIVIDUAL MUST NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND USER MAY NOT USE
THE TIGRIS OBJECT STORAGE SERVICE. USER’S USE OF THE TIGRIS OBJECT STORAGE
SERVICE, AND TIGRIS DATA’S PROVISION OF THE TIGRIS OBJECT STORAGE SERVICE TO
USER, CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT BY TIGRIS DATA AND BY USER TO BE BOUND BY THIS
AGREEMENT.

**ARBITRATION NOTICE**. Except for certain kinds of disputes described in
Section 20, User agrees that disputes arising under this Agreement will be
resolved by binding, individual arbitration, and BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT,
USER AND TIGRIS DATA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO
PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

1.  **Tigris Object Storage Service Overview.** Tigris Data makes available a
    global object storage service that enables developers to quickly and easily
    store and access any amount of data for a wide range of use cases

    registration and your use of the Tigris Object Storage Service is in
    compliance with any and all Laws.

3.  **Accounts and Registration.**

    3.1 **Accounts.** Unless you have purchased or are accessing the Tigris
    Cloud Service through an authorized reseller of Tigris Data, in order to

    You may also register and log into the Tigris Object Storage Service through
    third party identity providers such as GitHub or Google.

    3.2 **Accuracy of Information.** When you register for an account, you may
    be required to provide us with some information about yourself, such as your

    that you will keep it accurate and up to date at all times.

    3.3 **Account Security.** You are responsible for the security of your
    account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur through the

4.  **End Users.** Enterprise Users may be permitted to invite other users to
    register for accounts in order to access the Tigris Object Storage Service
    and Customer Content (such other users, “End Users”). User is responsible
    for each End User’s use of and access to the Tigris Object Storage Service
    and the Customer Content and for each End User’s compliance with this
    Agreement. If User becomes aware of any violation of this Agreement caused
    by an End User, User will immediately suspend access to the Tigris Object
    Storage Service and Customer Content by such End User.

5.  **Fees.** Tigris Data currently provides you with access to and use of the
    Tigris Object Storage Service for free. Tigris Data in its sole discretion
    will eventually charge you fees to access and use the Tigris Object Storage
    Service. Tigris Data will provide you with advance notice of any such
    changes before they take effect.

6.  Tigris Object Storage Service

    6.1 **Permitted Use.** Subject to User’s complete and ongoing compliance
    with this Agreement, Tigris Data grants User a limited, non-exclusive,

    use in accordance with this Agreement.

    6.2 **Restrictions.** Except and solely to the extent such a restriction is

    manner that violates any Law. Additionally, User must not use the Tigris
    Object Storage Service with Prohibited Content (or Transmit Prohibited
    Content to Tigris Data or the Tigris Object Storage Service) or for High
    Risk Activities. User acknowledges that the Tigris Object Storage Service is
    not intended to meet any legal obligations for these uses, and that Tigris
    Data is not a Business Associate as defined under HIPAA. Notwithstanding
    anything else in this Agreement, Tigris Data has no liability for Prohibited
    Content, including the transmission of Prohibited Content to the Tigris
    Object Storage Service, or use of the Tigris Object Storage Service for High
    Risk Activities.

    6.3 **Feedback.** We respect and appreciate the thoughts and comments from
    our users. If User chooses to provide input and suggestions regarding
    existing functionalities, problems with or proposed modifications or
    improvements to the Tigris Object Storage Service (“Feedback”), then User
    hereby grants Tigris Data an unrestricted, perpetual, irrevocable,
    non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free right and license to use the
    Feedback in any manner and for any purpose, including to improve the Tigris
    Object Storage Service and create other products and services. We will have
    no obligation to provide User with attribution for any Feedback User
    provides to us.

    6.4 **API.** The Tigris Object Storage Service includes the Tigris Data
    application programming interface (“API”). To the extent you use the API,
    you will comply with our published API documentation and any other
    information or policies we make available from time to time. In addition to
    any restrictions or limitations set forth in such documentation (and without
    limiting this Agreement), you will not use the API in a manner that, in
    Tigris Data’s discretion, exceeds specified call/query volumes, constitutes
    abusive or excessive use, or otherwise fails to comply with or is
    inconsistent with this Agreement.

    6.5 **Ownership; Proprietary Rights.** The Tigris Object Storage Service is
    owned and operated by Tigris Data. The visual interfaces, graphics, design,
    compilation, information, data, computer code (including source code or
    object code), products, software, services, and all other elements of the
    Tigris Object Storage Service provided by Tigris Data (“Materials”) are
    protected by intellectual property and other laws. All Materials included in
    the Tigris Object Storage Service are the property of Tigris Data or its
    third-party licensors. Except as expressly authorized by Tigris Data, User
    may not make use of the Materials. There are no implied licenses in this
    Agreement and Tigris Data reserves all rights to the Materials not granted
    expressly in this Agreement.

7.  **Service Levels and Support.** During the Term, Tigris Data will use
    commercially reasonable efforts to (a) keep the Tigris Object Storage
    Service operational, excluding scheduled and emergency maintenance; and (b)
    implement commercially reasonable measures to secure the Tigris Object
    Storage Service against unauthorized access to Customer Content and User
    Data; provided that User is solely responsible for maintaining the security
    and operability of those systems and devices that User use to access the
    Tigris Object Storage Service.

8.  **Modifications.** We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the Tigris
    Object Storage Service at any time (including by limiting or discontinuing
    certain features of Tigris Object Storage Service), temporarily or
    permanently, without notice to you and without liability. You should retain
    copies of all Customer Content and User Data so that you have permanent
    copies in the event the Tigris Object Storage Service is modified in such a
    way that you lose access to same.

9.  **Third-Party Terms.**

    9.1 **Third-Party Services.** Tigris Data may provide tools through the
    Tigris Object Storage Service that enable you to export information,
    including Customer Content, to third-party services, including through
    features that allow you to link your account on the Tigris Object Storage
    Service with an account on the third-party service. By using one of these
    tools, you hereby authorize Tigris Data to transfer your information and
    Customer Content to the applicable third-party service. Third-party services
    are not under Tigris Data’s control, and, to the fullest extent permitted by
    law, Tigris Data is not responsible for any third-party service’s use of
    your exported information. Please be sure to review the terms of use and
    privacy policy of any third-party services before you share any Customer
    Content or information with such third-party services. Once sharing occurs,
    Tigris Data will have no control over the information that has been shared.

    9.2 **Third-Party Software.** The Tigris Object Storage Service may include
    or incorporate third-party software components that are generally available
    free of charge under licenses granting recipients broad rights to copy,
    modify, and distribute those components (“Third-Party Components”). Although
    the Tigris Object Storage Service is provided to User subject to this
    Agreement, nothing in this Agreement prevents, restricts, or is intended to
    prevent or restrict you from obtaining Third-Party Components under the
    applicable third-party licenses or to limit your use of Third-Party
    Components under those third-party licenses.

10. **Customer Content**

    10.1 **Limited License.** Except as provided in this Section 10, Tigris Data
    obtains no rights under this Agreement from User (or User’s licensors) to
    any Customer Content. By Transmitting Customer Content to Tigris Data or the
    Tigris Object Storage Service, User consents to Tigris Data’s use of
    Customer Content to provide the Tigris Object Storage Service to User and
    hereby grant Tigris Data a worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable,
    royalty-free, fully paid right and license (with the right to sublicense
    through multiple tiers) to host, store and transfer such Customer Content,
    in whole or in part, solely to provide the Tigris Object Storage Service to
    User. Tigris Data will not access or use Customer Content except as
    necessary to maintain or provide the Tigris Object Storage Service, or as
    necessary to comply with Laws or a binding order of a governmental body.
    Tigris Data will not disclose Customer Content to any government or third
    party except as necessary to comply with Laws or a binding order of a
    governmental body. For clarity, Tigris Data’s Privacy Policy does not apply
    to Customer Content.

    10.2 **Adequate Rights.** User represents and warrants to Tigris Data that:
    (a) User or User’s licensors owns all right, title, and interest in and to
    Customer Content; (b) User has all rights in Customer Content necessary to
    grant the rights contemplated by this Agreement; and (c) none of Customer’s
    Content or User’s use of the Tigris Object Storage Service will violate the
    terms of this Agreement.

    10.3 **Additional User Responsibilities.** User is responsible for all
    Customer Content, including its content and accuracy, and will comply with
    Laws and this Agreement when using the Tigris Object Storage Service. User
    will ensure that all Customer Content and User’s use of all Customer Content
    and the Tigris Object Storage Service will not violate any of the terms of
    this Agreement or any Law. User is responsible for properly using the Tigris
    Object Storage Service and represents and warrants that it has made all
    disclosures, provided all notices, and has obtained all rights, consents,
    and permissions necessary for Tigris Data to Process Customer Content and
    User Data as set forth in this Agreement without violating or infringing
    Laws, third-party rights, or terms or policies that apply to the Customer
    Content or User Data.

    10.4 **Customer Content Disclaimer.** Tigris Data is under no obligation to
    edit, monitor or control Customer Content or any Content that any user
    Transmits to the Tigris Object Storage Service. Tigris Data will not be in
    any way responsible or liable for any such Content or Customer Content.
    Tigris Data may, however, at any time and without prior notice, screen,
    remove, edit, or block any Customer Content that in our sole judgment
    violates this Agreement, is alleged to violate the rights of third parties,
    or is otherwise objectionable. You agree to waive, and do waive, any legal
    or equitable right or remedy you have or may have against Tigris Data with
    respect to Customer Content. If notified by a user or content owner that
    Customer Content allegedly does not conform to this Agreement, we may
    investigate the allegation and determine in our sole discretion whether to
    remove the Customer Content, which we reserve the right to do at any time
    and without notice. For clarity, Tigris Data does not permit infringing
    activities on the Tigris Object Storage Service.

11. **User Data**

    11.1 **Use of User Data.** User grant Tigris Data a non-exclusive,

    14.2 **DMCA Notification.** We comply with the provisions of the Digital
    Millennium Copyright Act applicable to Internet service providers (17 U.S.C.
    § 512, as amended). If you have an intellectual property rights-related
    complaint about any material on the Tigris Object Storage Service, you may
    contact our Designated Agent at the following address:

        Tigris Data Inc.<br/>
        Attn: Legal Department (IP Notification)<br/>
        1250 Borregas Ave,<br/>
        #87, Sunnyvale, CA 94089<br/>
        Email: [ip-infringement@tigrisdata.com](mailto:ip-infringement@tigrisdata.com)

    14.3 **Procedure for Reporting Claimed Infringement.** If you believe that
    any content made available on or through the Tigris Object Storage Service
    has been used or exploited in a manner that infringes an intellectual
    property right you own or control, then please promptly send a written
    “Notification of Claimed Infringement” to the Designated Agent identified
    above containing the following information:

        a. an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other right being infringed;

        b. a description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property right that you claim has been infringed;

        c. a description of the material that you claim is infringing and where it is located on the Tigris Object Storage Service;

        d. your address, telephone number, and email address;

        e. a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the use of the materials on the Tigris Object Storage Service of which you are complaining is not authorized by the copyright or other intellectual property right owner, its agent, or Laws; and

        f. a statement by you that the above information in your notice is accurate and that, under penalty of perjury, you are the copyright or other intellectual property right owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner’s behalf.

    Your Notification of Claimed Infringement may be shared by Tigris Data with
    the user alleged to have infringed a right you own or control as well as
    with the operators of publicly available databases that track notifications
    of claimed infringement, and you consent to Tigris Data making such
    disclosures. You should consult with your own lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. § 512
    to confirm your obligations to provide a valid notice of claimed
    infringement.

    14.4 **Repeat Infringers.** Tigris Data’s policy is to: (a) remove or
    disable access to material that Tigris Data believes in good faith, upon
    notice from an intellectual property rights owner or authorized agent, is
    infringing the intellectual property rights of a third party by being made
    available through the Tigris Object Storage Service; and (b) in appropriate
    circumstances, to terminate the accounts of and block access to the Tigris
    Object Storage Service by any user who repeatedly or egregiously infringes
    other people’s copyright or other intellectual property rights. Tigris Data
    will terminate the accounts of users that are determined by Tigris Data to
    be repeat infringers. Tigris Data reserves the right, however, to suspend or
    terminate accounts of users in our sole discretion.

    14.5 **Counter Notification.** If you receive a notification from Tigris
    Data that material made available by you on or through the Tigris Object
    Storage Service has been the subject of a Notification of Claimed
    Infringement, then you will have the right to provide Tigris Data with what
    is called a “Counter Notification.” To be effective, a Counter Notification
    must be in writing, provided to Tigris Data’s Designated Agent through one
    of the methods identified in Section 14.2 (DMCA Notification), and include
    substantially the following information:

        a. your physical or electronic signature;

        b. identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;

        c. a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and

        d. your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if you are residing outside of the United States, then for any judicial district in which Tigris Data may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under Section 14.2 (DMCA Notification) above or an agent of that person.

    A party submitting a Counter Notification should consult a lawyer or see 17
    U.S.C. § 512 to confirm the party’s obligations to provide a valid counter
    notification under the Copyright Act.

    14.6 **Reposting of Content Subject to a Counter Notification.** If you
    submit a Counter Notification to Tigris Data in response to a Notification
    of Claimed Infringement, then Tigris Data will promptly provide the person
    who provided the Notification of Claimed Infringement with a copy of your
    Counter Notification and inform that person that Tigris Data will replace
    the removed Customer Content or cease disabling access to it in 10 business
    days, and Tigris Data will replace the removed Customer Content and cease
    disabling access to it not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days
    following receipt of the Counter Notification, unless Tigris Data’s
    Designated Agent receives notice from the party that submitted the
    Notification of Claimed Infringement that such person has filed an action
    seeking a court order to restrain the user from engaging in infringing
    activity relating to the material on Tigris Data’s system or network.

    14.7 **False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter
    Notifications.** The Copyright Act provides at 17 U.S.C. § 512(f) that:
    “[a]ny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under [Section 512 of
    the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512)] (1) that material or activity is
    infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by
    mistake or misidentification, will be liable for any damages, including
    costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any
    copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service
    provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of [Tigris
    Data] relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to
    the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the
    removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.” Tigris Data reserves
    the right to seek damages from any party that submits a Notification of
    Claimed Infringement or Counter Notification in violation of Laws.

15. **Suspension**

    15.1 **General.** Tigris Data may immediately suspend User’s (and its End
    Users’) access to the Tigris Object Storage Service if Tigris Data
    reasonably determines that: (a) User (or any End User) breaches any term of
    this Agreement; (b) changes to Law or new laws require that Tigris Data
    suspend the Tigris Object Storage Service (in whole or in part) or otherwise
    may impose additional liability on the part of Tigris Data; or (c) User’s
    (or its End Users’) actions or use of the Tigris Object Storage Service (i)
    risk harm to any of Tigris Data’s other customers or the security,
    availability, or integrity of the Tigris Object Storage Service; (ii) could
    adversely impact Tigris Data’s systems, the Tigris Object Storage Service or
    the systems or content of any other Tigris Object Storage Service user;
    (iii) could subject any Tigris Data Entity or any third party to liability;
    or (iv) could be fraudulent. Where practicable, Tigris Data will use
    reasonable efforts to provide User with prior notice of the suspension. If
    in Tigris Data’s sole but reasonable discretion the issue that led to the
    suspension is resolved, Tigris Data will restore User’s (and its End Users’)
    access to the Tigris Object Storage Service.

    15.2 **Effects.** If Tigris Data suspends User’s (or any End Users’) right
    to access or use any portion or all of the Tigris Object Storage Service,
    (a) User will be responsible for all fees and charges you incur during the
    period of suspension that Tigris Data bills to Users.

16. **Term; Termination**

    16.1 **Term.** This Agreement is effective beginning when User accepts this
    Agreement or first accesses or uses the Tigris Object Storage Service and
    ending when terminated as described in Section 16.2 (the “Term”).

    16.2 **Termination.**

    a. **For Convenience.** User may terminate User’s account and this Agreement
    for any reason by removing all Customer Content from the Tigris Object
    Storage Service or contacting customer service at support@tigrisdata.com. We
    may terminate this Agreement for any reason by providing User at least 30
    days’ advance notice.

    b. **For Cause.** Either party may terminate this Agreement if: (i) the
    other party fails to cure a material breach of this Agreement (including a
    failure to pay fees) within 30 days after notice (in which case User will
    close its account no later than the effective date of termination set forth
    in such notice); and (ii) upon notice to the other party if the other party
    (x) ceases operation without a successor; or (y) seeks protection under a
    bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition,
    or comparable proceeding, or if such a proceeding is instituted against that
    party and not dismissed within 60 days. Tigris Data may also terminate this
    Agreement for cause immediately upon notice to User if Tigris Data has the
    right to suspend under Section 15 and the issue giving Tigris Data the right
    to suspend either is not capable of being remedied or has not been remedied
    within 30 days of us suspending User’s (or any of its End User’s) access
    under Section 15.

    16.3 **Effect of Termination.**

    a. **General.** Upon termination of this Agreement: (a) except as provided
    in clause (d) below, all of User’s rights under this Agreement immediately
    terminate and User (and its End Users) must immediately cease all use of the
    Tigris Object Storage Service (and must uninstall any application
    programming interface made available by Tigris Data); (b) User (and its End
    Users) will no longer be authorized to access User’s (or any End User’s)
    account or the Tigris Object Storage Service; (c) User must pay Tigris Data
    any unpaid amount that was due prior to termination; and (d) all payment
    obligations accrued prior to termination and Sections 3.3, 4, 5, 6.3, 6.5,
    11, 16.3, 17, 18, 19, 20, and will survive.

    b. **Post-Termination.** Unless Tigris Data terminates this Agreement
    pursuant to Section 16.2(b), during the 30 days immediately following the
    effective date of termination of this Agreement as set forth in a notice of
    termination (or if terminated by User for convenience by contacting Tigris
    Data customer service, then 30 days following the date of such contact),
    Tigris Data will not take action to remove from the Tigris Object Storage
    Service any Customer Content as a result of the termination, and Tigris Data
    will allow User (but not End Users) to retrieve Customer Content from the
    Tigris Object Storage Service provided that User has paid all amounts due
    under this Agreement. After that 30 day period, Tigris Data will be under no
    obligation to store or retain any Customer Content and may delete the
    Customer Content at any time in its sole discretion. For any use of the
    Tigris Object Storage Service after termination of this Agreement, the terms
    of this Agreement (including any payment obligations for the Tigris Object
    Storage Service under Section 5) will apply. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
    User is solely responsible for retaining copies of (i) any User Data stored
    on the Tigris Object Storage Service; and (ii) all Customer Content
    Transmitted to the Tigris Object Storage Service, in each case since upon
    termination of your account, User (and its End Users) may lose access rights
    to User’s (and its End Users’) account(s). If User’s account has been
    terminated for a breach of this Agreement, then User is prohibited from
    creating a new account on the Tigris Object Storage Service using a
    different name, email address or other forms of account verification.

17. **Indemnification.**

    17.1 **General.** To the fullest extent permitted by law, User is
    responsible for its (and its End Users’) use of and access to the Tigris
    Object Storage Service, and User will defend and indemnify Tigris Data and
    each other Tigris Data Entity from and against any third-party claim, and
    any related liability, damage, loss, and expense, including attorneys’ fees
    and costs, arising out of or connected with: (a) User’s (and each End
    User’s) use of the Tigris Object Storage Service (including any activities
    under your or their account); (b) User’s (and any End User’s) violation of
    any portion of this Agreement, any representation, warranty, or agreement
    referenced in this Agreement, or any Law; (c) the Customer Content,
    including any allegation that User (or any End User) or any Customer Content
    infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates any third-party right,
    including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality,
    other property, or privacy right; or (e) any dispute or issue between User
    and any End User. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the
    exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to
    indemnification by User (without limiting User’s indemnification obligations
    with respect to that matter), and in that case, User agrees to cooperate
    with our defense of those claims.

    17.2 **Intellectual Property.** Tigris Data will defend User from and
    against any third-party claim to the extent alleging that the Tigris Object
    Storage Service as operated by Tigris Data, when used by User (and each End
    User) as permitted under this Agreement infringes or misappropriates a third
    party’s U.S. patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret, and will pay the
    amount of any damages and costs awarded against User (including reasonable
    attorneys’ fees) in a final judgement of, or agreed by Tigris Data in a
    settlement of, the claim; provided that Tigris Data will not have any
    obligations or liability under this Section 17.2 for (a) infringement or
    misappropriation resulting from use of the Tigris Object Storage Service in
    combination with products, services, software, data, content or other items
    not provided by Tigris Data; (b) unauthorized use of the Tigris Object
    Storage Service; or (c) if User settles or makes any admissions about a
    claim without Tigris Data’s prior consent. For any claim covered by this
    Section 17.2, Tigris Data will, at its election, either: (i) procure the
    rights to use that portion of the Tigris Object Storage Service alleged to
    be infringing; (ii) replace the alleged infringing portion of the Tigris
    Object Storage Service with a non-infringing alternative; (iii) modify the
    alleged infringing portion of the Tigris Object Storage Service to make it
    non-infringing; or (iv) terminate the allegedly infringing portion of the
    Tigris Object Storage Service or this Agreement. This Section 17.2 sets out
    User’s exclusive remedy and Tigris Data’s entire liability regarding
    infringement or misappropriation of third-party intellectual property
    rights.

    17.3 **Procedure.** The indemnifying party’s obligations in this Section 17
    are subject to it receiving: (a) prompt written notice of the claim; (b)
    except as set forth in Section 17.1, the exclusive right to control and
    direct the investigation, defense, and settlement of the claim; and (c) all
    reasonably necessary cooperation of the indemnified party, at the
    indemnifying party’s expense for reasonable out-of-pocket costs. The
    indemnifying party may not settle any claim without the indemnified party’s
    prior consent if settlement would require the indemnified party to admit
    fault or take or refrain from taking any action (other than relating to use
    of the Tigris Object Storage Service, when Tigris Data is the indemnifying
    party). The indemnified party may participate in a claim with its own
    counsel at its own expense.

    BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL
    COMPONENTS, AND TIGRIS DATA DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL
    BE CORRECTED. THE TIGRIS DATA ENTITIES ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR THE
    DELETION OF OR FAILURE TO STORE ANY CUSTOMER CONTENT OR USER DATA OR OTHER
    COMMUNICATIONS MAINTAINED OR TRANSMITTED THROUGH USE OF THE TIGRIS OBJECT
    STORAGE SERVICES. USER IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR SECURING AND BACKING UP THE
    CUSTOMER CONTENT AND USER DATA.

    18.2 NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY USER
    FROM THE TIGRIS OBJECT STORAGE SERVICE OR TIGRIS DATA ENTITIES OR ANY
    MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE TIGRIS OBJECT STORAGE SERVICE
    WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE TIGRIS DATA ENTITIES OR THE
    TIGRIS OBJECT STORAGE SERVICE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS
    AGREEMENT. TIGRIS DATA IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT
    FROM THE TIGRIS OBJECT STORAGE SERVICE OR USER’S (OR ANY END USER’S) DEALING
    WITH ANY OTHER SERVICE USER. USER UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT USER (AND ALL
    END USERS) USE ANY PORTION OF THE TIGRIS OBJECT STORAGE SERVICE AT USER’S
    OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT TIGRIS DATA IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY
    DAMAGE TO USER’S (OR ANY END USER’S) PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER
    SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE TIGRIS OBJECT STORAGE
    SERVICE) OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, MATERIALS OR INFORMATION, INCLUDING CUSTOMER
    CONTENT.

    18.3 THE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION 18 APPLY TO
    THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. Tigris Data does not disclaim any
    warranty or other right that Tigris Data is prohibited from disclaiming
    under Law.

19. **Limitation of Liability**

    19.1 TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE TIGRIS
    DATA ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO USER FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
    CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS,
    GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS), OR FOR THE VALUE OF ANY CUSTOMER
    CONTENT, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO USER’S (OR ANY END USER’S) ACCESS TO
    OR USE OF, OR USER’S (OR ANY END USER’S) INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE
    TIGRIS OBJECT STORAGE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT (INCLUDING
    CUSTOMER CONTENT) ON THE TIGRIS OBJECT STORAGE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON
    WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL
    THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY TIGRIS DATA ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.

    19.2 EXCEPT FOR TIGRIS DATA’S OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 17.2 AND AS PROVIDED
    IN SECTIONS 20.5 AND 20.6, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW THE
    AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE TIGRIS DATA ENTITIES FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT
    OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR ANY INABILITY TO USE ANY PORTION OF THE
    TIGRIS OBJECT STORAGE SERVICE OR OTHERWISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN

    USER HAS PAID TO TIGRIS DATA FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE TIGRIS OBJECT
    STORAGE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT OR CIRCUMSTANCE GIVING
    RISE TO THE CLAIM AND (b) US$100.

    19.3 EACH PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF
    LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO
    AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. THIS
    ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE
    PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER
    PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 19 WILL APPLY
    EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

20. **Dispute Resolution and Arbitration**

    20.1 **Generally.** Except as described in Section 20.2 and 20.3, User and
    Tigris Data agree that every dispute arising in connection with this
    Agreement, the Tigris Object Storage Service, or communications from us will
    be resolved through binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral
    arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, is less formal than a court
    proceeding, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and is
    subject to very limited review by courts. This agreement to arbitrate
    disputes includes all claims whether based in contract, tort, statute,
    fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of
    whether a claim arises during or after the termination of this Agreement.
    Any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability
    of this binding arbitration agreement will be resolved by the arbitrator.

    YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND
    TIGRIS DATA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE
    IN A CLASS ACTION.

    20.2 **Exceptions.** Although we are agreeing to arbitrate most disputes
    between us, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or
    otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action
    in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the
    applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c)
    seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to
    file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement
    claim.

    20.3 **Opt-Out.** If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding
    arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 20 within 30
    days after the date that you agree to this Agreement by sending a letter to
    Tigris Data Inc., Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 1250
    Borregas Ave, #87, Sunnyvale, CA 94089 that specifies: your full legal name,
    the email address associated with your account on the Tigris Object Storage
    Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (“Opt-Out
    Notice”). Once Tigris Data receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 20
    will be void and any action arising out of this Agreement will be resolved
    as set forth in Section 22.2. The remaining provisions of this Agreement
    will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.

    20.4 **Arbitrator.** This arbitration agreement, and any arbitration between
    us, is subject the Federal Arbitration Act and will be administered by the
    JAMS under the rules applicable to consumer disputes (collectively, “JAMS
    Rules”) as modified by this Agreement. The JAMS Rules and filing forms are
    available online at www.jamsadr.org, by calling the JAMS at +1-800-352-5267
    or by contacting Tigris Data.

    20.5 **Commencing Arbitration.** Before initiating arbitration, a party must
    first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified
    U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other
    party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail
    (“Notice of Arbitration”). Tigris Data’s address for Notice is: Tigris Data
    Inc., 1250 Borregas Ave, #87, Sunnyvale, CA 94089. The Notice of Arbitration
    must: (a) identify the name or account number of the party making the claim;
    (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth
    the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith
    efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an
    agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is
    received, you or Tigris Data may commence an arbitration proceeding. If you
    commence arbitration in accordance with this Agreement, Tigris Data will
    reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for
    more than US$10,000 or if Tigris Data has received 25 or more similar
    demands for arbitration, in which case the payment of any fees will be
    decided by the JAMS Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance
    of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for
    an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule
    of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by
    the JAMS Rules and the other party may seek reimbursement for any fees paid
    to JAMS.

    20.6 **Arbitration Proceedings.** Any arbitration hearing will take place in
    the county and state of your billing address unless we agree otherwise or,
    if the claim is for US$10,000 or less (and does not seek injunctive relief),
    you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the
    basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a telephonic or
    video hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the JAMS
    Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. During the
    arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Tigris Data
    must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a
    final decision and award, if any. Regardless of the manner in which the
    arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written
    decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on
    which the decision and award, if any, are based.

    20.7 **Arbitration Relief.** Except as provided in Section 20.8, the
    arbitrator can award any relief that would be available if the claims had
    been brough in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator awards
    you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by
    Tigris Data before an arbitrator was selected, Tigris Data will pay to you
    the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b) US$10,000.
    The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on all parties, except (1)
    for judicial review expressly permitted by law or (2) if the arbitrator’s
    award includes an award of injunctive relief against a party, in which case
    that party shall have the right to seek judicial review of the injunctive
    relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that shall not be bound by the
    arbitrator’s application or conclusions of law. Judgment on the award may be
    entered in any court having jurisdiction.

    20.8 **No Class Actions.** YOU AND TIGRIS DATA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING
    CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS
    A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
    PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Tigris Data agree otherwise, the
    arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not
    otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

    20.9 **Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.** If Tigris Data makes
    any substantive change to this arbitration provision, you may reject the
    change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Tigris
    Data’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with
    Tigris Data will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision,
    as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.

    20.10 **Enforceability.** If Section 20.8 or the entirety of this Section 20
    is found to be unenforceable, or if Tigris Data receives an Opt-Out Notice
    from you, then the entirety of this Section 20 will be null and void and, in
    that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 22.2
    will govern any action arising out of or related to this Agreement.

21. **Modifications to the Agreement.** We may, from time to time, change the
    terms of this Agreement. Please check this Agreement periodically for
    changes. Revisions will be effective immediately except that, for existing
    users, material revisions will be effective 30 days after posting or notice
    to User of the revisions unless otherwise stated. We may require that User
    accepts the modified Agreement in order to continue to use the Tigris Object
    Storage Service. If User does not agree to the modified Agreement, then User
    should remove all Customer Content and discontinue use of the Tigris Object
    Storage Service. Except as expressly permitted in this Section 21, this
    Agreement may be amended only by a written agreement signed by authorized
    representatives of the parties to this Agreement.

22. **Miscellaneous**

    22.1 **General Terms.** This Agreement, including the Privacy Policy and any
    other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into this Agreement,
    are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and
    Tigris Data regarding your use of the Tigris Object Storage Service. You may
    not assign or transfer this Agreement or your rights under this Agreement,
    in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior
    written consent. We may assign this Agreement and all rights granted under
    this Agreement, including with respect to Customer Content and your User
    Data, at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require
    performance of any provision will not affect our right to require
    performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any
    breach or default of this Agreement, or any provision of this Agreement, be
    a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision
    itself. The parties are independent contractors, not agents, partners, or
    joint venturers. Use of Section headers in this Agreement is for convenience
    only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision.
    Throughout this Agreement the use of the word “including” means “including
    but not limited to.” If any part of this Agreement is held to be invalid or
    unenforceable, then the unenforceable part will be given effect to the
    greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force
    and effect. Except as set forth in Section 17.1, this Agreement does not
    create any third-party beneficiary rights in any individual or entity that
    is not a party to this Agreement.

    22.2 **Governing Law.** This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State
    of California without regard to conflict of law principles. You and Tigris
    Data submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts
    and federal courts located within Santa Clara County, California for
    resolution of any lawsuit or court proceeding permitted under this
    Agreement.

    22.3 **Data Processing Addendum.** To the extent Tigris Data will Process
    Customer Content, User Data, or personal information to provide Tigris
    Object Storage Services to Customer, each Party will comply with its
    obligations in the Data Processing Addendum set forth in Schedule 1 hereto,
    which is incorporated into this Agreement.

    22.4 **Force Majeure.** Except for payment obligations, neither party is
    liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this
    Agreement due to events beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike,
    blockade, war, pandemic, act of terrorism, riot, Internet or utility
    failures, refusal of government license, or natural disaster.

    22.5 **Confidentiality and Publicity.** User may use Tigris Confidential
    Information only in connection with User’s use of the Tigris Object Storage
    Service as permitted under this Agreement. User will not disclose Tigris
    Confidential Information during the Term or at any time during the 5-year
    period following the end of the Term. User will take all reasonable measures
    to avoid disclosure, dissemination or unauthorized use of Tigris
    Confidential Information, including, at a minimum, those measures you take
    to protect your own confidential information of a similar nature. User will
    not issue any press release or make any other public communication with
    respect to this Agreement or your use of the Tigris Object Storage Service
    without Tigris Data’s prior written consent, in each instance.
