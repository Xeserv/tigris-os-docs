# About Tigris Data

Tigris Data was founded in 2022 by
[Ovais](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ovaistariq/),
[Himank](https://www.linkedin.com/in/himank-chaudhary-1937b958/), and,
[Yevgeniy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/efirsov/) with the mission of simplifying
storage for developers.

Before starting Tigris Data, we spent almost six years working closely together
at Uber, where we built and operated Uber's global storage platform, leading
projects such as [Docstore](https://eng.uber.com/schemaless-sql-database/),
[Herb](https://eng.uber.com/herb-datacenter-replication/), and
[DBEvents](https://eng.uber.com/dbevents-ingestion-framework/).

Our experiences have given us a lot of important lessons. We've learned about
the importance of making architectural choices that can scale, establishing
efficiency as a core principle, hiring the right talent, and cultivating a
culture that supports diversity, innovation, and growth.
